	<h3>The Glasgow Coma Scale</h3>
	<h4>Neil D. A. Stewart</h4>
	<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Glasgow-Coma-Scale-Neil-Stewart/9781472113115"><img src="../Assets/glasgow.jpg" alt="The Glasgow Coma Scale"></a>
	<p id="glasgow">When Lynne offers money to a homeless man on Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street she is shocked to recognise Angus, her former art tutor from college. Lynne once revered him, even dreamed of becoming an artist under his tutelage. Now, she works as a supervisor at an insurance call-centre. And as for Angus, he has fallen on even harder times ...She insists on inviting him to stay at her flat, but just as Angus doesn't go out of his way to explain the reasons for his misfortune, neither is Lynne's insistence on taking him in to her home purely altruistic. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a barbed love letter to the city, a dysfunctional romance, and a story about damage: the kind done unthinkingly, the kind done deliberately, and the worst sort - the harm we do even as we're trying to do 'the right thing'. 'Neil Stewart is the kind of writer who appears once in a generation, gifts fully formed. Through the unforgettable duo of Angus and Lynne, he takes us to places where other novels fear to treat, from the perils of life on a park bench through the murky grey areas of love to the ineffable mysteries of art. Compassionate, brave, singing with life, The Glasgow Coma Scale is an outstanding debut from an extraordinary talent.' Paul Murray, author of Skippy Dies.</p>

	<h3>The Grownup</h3>
	<h4>Gillian Flynn</h4>
	<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Grownup-Gillian-Flynn/9781474603041" target="_blank"><img src="../Assets/grownup.jpg" alt="The Grownup"></a>
	<p id="grownup">A young woman is making a living faking it as a cut-price psychic (with some illegal soft-core sex work on the side). She makes a decent wage mostly by telling people what they want to hear. But then she meets Susan Burke. Susan moved to the city one year ago with her husband and 15-year-old stepson Miles. They live in a Victorian house called Carterhook Manor. Susan has become convinced that some malevolent spirit is inhabiting their home. The young woman doesn't believe in exorcism or the supernatural. However when she enters the house for the first time, she begins to feel it too, as if the very house is watching her, waiting, biding its time. The Grownup, which originally appeared as 'What Do You Do?' in George R. R. Martin's Rogues anthology, proves once again that Gillian Flynn is one of the world's most original and skilled voices in fiction.</p>

Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns about love for herself and the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (`I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare`) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a modern American classic that will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.</p>

	<h3>American Girls</h3>
	<h4>Alison Umminger</h4>
	<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/American-Girls-Alison-Umminger/9781250075000" target="_blank"><img src="../Assets/americangirls.jpg" alt="American Girls"></a>
	<p id="americangirls">A bittersweet, honest, and widely acclaimed YA coming-of-age novel that distills honest truths about American girldom Anna is a fifteen-year-old girl slouching toward adulthood, and she's had it with her life at home. So Anna "borrows" her stepmom's credit card and runs away to Los Angeles, where her half-sister takes her in. But LA isn't quite the glamorous escape Anna had imagined. As Anna spends her days on TV and movie sets, she engrosses herself in a project researching the murderous Manson girls--and although the violence in her own life isn't the kind that leaves physical scars, she begins to notice the parallels between herself and the lost girls of LA, and of America, past and present. In Anna's singular voice, we glimpse not only a picture of life on the B-list in LA, but also a clear-eyed reflection on being young, vulnerable, lost, and female in America--in short, on the B-list of life. Alison Umminger writes about girls, violence, and which people society deems worthy of caring about, which ones it doesn't, in a way not often seen in teen fiction.</p>

The story follows Rosa from her family life in Jewish Poland, where she became the leader of a general strike at age fifteen and was exiled from her homeland at eighteen, to her immersion into the then largest radical party in the world, the German Social Democratic Party, to her founding of the German Communist Party and leadership of the German revolution of 1919. This beautifully drawn graphic life gives "Red Rosa" her due as an iconic radical, but also portrays a fascinating woman with a rich love life, struggles with physical disability, and an abiding love of literature and theater. Rosa will contribute to the growing understanding of one of the 20th century's greatest revolutionaries.</p>
